Test Descriptions: 

rawPacket1.txt will be used in test 1 to 4

1. Simple ALLOW rule:
This is to test a basic acceptance return. To ensure the fundamentals are working correctly.

2. Simple Deny rule: 
This is to test a basic deny return. To ensure the fundamentals are working correctly.
3. Simple Unspecified rule: 
This is to test a basic unspecified return. To ensure the fundamentals are working correctly.

4. Rule with all equal Ports and IP address but different Protocol:
This is to test the correctness of the program. We want to ensure that even though everything is correct, it does not over look at the protocol. 

5. Rule with Wild-star in Port Number
This is to test the correctness of the program. To check we allowed all packets with the same IP address, yet with different Port numbers.

6. Rule with Wild-star in first part of IP address (10.10.10.*): 
This is to test we can handle the wild-star correctly with IP address. Depending of the location, it implies more access or less access.

7. Rule with Wild-star in Second part of IP address (10.10.*): 
This is to test we can handle the wild-star correctly with IP address. Depending of the location, it implies more access or less access.

8. Rule with Wild-star in Third part of IP address (10.*):
This is to test we can handle the wild-star correctly with IP address. Depending of the location, it implies more access or less access.

9. Rule with Wild-star in Both IP address and Port: 
This is to test we can handle the wild-star correctly with IP address and Port numbers.

10. Different transport Layer Protocol: 
This is to test for incommoding packets without TCP or UDP, thus to ensure we ‘unspecified’ the packet.
